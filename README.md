# Hello, please take a look at [`NER-demo.ipynb`](https://github.com/JoeMansour2003/Skynet-NER/blob/main/NER-demo.ipynb) 
It is where my code lives. I added comments so that you can easily understand it even if you don't know a thing about Machine Learning or AI.
<br>
I was unable to upload the actual models as they are too large but feel free to contact me at [joemansour2003@gmail.com](mailto:joemansour2003@gmail.com) for a demo.
<br>
Thank you
